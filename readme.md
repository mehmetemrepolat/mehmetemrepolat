- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mehmet Emre Polat
I'm a 4rd year student at Kocaeli University Information Systems Engineering. I am a quick learner and apply what I have learned to the problems I encounter and find solutions. Especially in the field of software, I am able to produce original solutions to the problems I encounter during project development. By taking an active role in many social communities, I gained experience in project management, teamwork and team leadership. With these works, I took myself further in communication and gained new connections from the industry.
Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning and Computer Vision topics. Iâ€™m currently learning on this topics.
